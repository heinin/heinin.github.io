    <h3 class="first-title">Response to CAR T cell therapies in patients with brain tumors</h3>
    <p>Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive, lethal type of cancer that can occur in the brain or the spinal cord. The average survival time is 12-18 months after diagnosis, with only 5% of GBM patients surviving more than five years. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy shows promise in treating GBM and other brain tumors. We work on a number of correlative studies to better understand the patient response to CAR T therapy.</p>

    <p>With our collaborators as City of Hope, we are investigating the factors impacting patient response to CAR T cell therapy in a number of pre-clinical and clinical trials across different CAR targets and cancer types, including adult and pediatric brain tumors. In trials spanning multiple CAR product types and CAR T therapy combined with other molecules, we are uncovering new mechanisms underlying treatment response and developing novel, more effective therapies to target these hard-to-treat tumors.</p>

    <p>As a significant component of these studies, we characterize CAR T product and cells from patient cerebrospinal fluid, peripheral blood, and tumors by integrating multimodal data types (gene and surface protein expression, T cell receptor sequencing, spatial transcriptomics) on a single-cell level to gain a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular drivers of response to CAR T therapy.</p>
    
    <p> This work is carried out in collaboration with Drs Christine Brown, Leo Wang, and Sharareh Gholamin.</p>

    <h3 class="first-title">Genetic and molecular drivers of pulmonary fibrosis</h3>
    <p>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a severe form of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) that typically leads to respiratory failure and death or a lung transplant within five years of diagnosis. In collaboration with Dr. Jonathan Kropski (Vanderbilt) and as a part of the Human Cell Atlas, The Banovich Lab has characterized heterogeneous cells types and gene regulatory networks in ILD and healthy lungs on a single-cell level.</p>
    <p>In collaboration with Dr. Davis McCarthy and postdoctoral researcher Dr. Christina Azodi (Univ. Melbourne), integrating whole-genome genotype data and gene expression measurements from more than 450,000 single cells, we are exploring genetic effects on gene regulation in disease-relevant cell types. By integrating these cell-type expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) with IPF GWAS (genome-wide association study) statistics, we reveal the regulatory mechanisms connecting IPF GWAS loci to disease risk and progression.</p>
